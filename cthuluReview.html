		<p>It may not be fair to review a giant collection of short stories as one, but, HP Lovecraft&#39;
			universe is steadily improved the more you read. This book is the best horror I have ever read. It never
			relies on jumpscares, instead it delivers a feeling of encroaching dread. At the end of every story
			there is always a realization at the last sentence to leave you thinking.
		</p>
		<p>
			This book is a difficult read and is quite long (600 pages). However, it is phenomenal at what it tries
			to achieve. If you are unsure as to how words on a page can be scary, look no further.

	<p>TL;DR 5-stars, one of my top books</p>
