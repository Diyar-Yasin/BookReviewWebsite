		<p>Like all older classics, this one started off slow. Older English and southern-accented text made it
			tough to get through the first half of the book if I am being honest. The payoff, however, was worth it.
			I did not expect to feel so much for the main character. His unbreakable will was awe-inspiring. I might
			have teared up a bit.
