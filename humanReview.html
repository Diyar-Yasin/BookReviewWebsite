		<p>A book I chose to read as a consequence of the long gone, Pewdiepie Book Club. This is a book I tore
			through in the span of 3 days, which by the way, I usually spend months reading books (sue me). 
			The glimpse into the mind of someone who was detached from his own humanity was so well executed. The
			moments, while very interesting, had a tinge of hospital white, a coldness that was funneled through
			the main character.
