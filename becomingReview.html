		<p>This is a good book. Michelle Obama and her struggles in being a mother and a First Lady were
			admirable and enjoyable to read. This book helped paint her in a light she wanted to be painted in, as opposed to the
			media protrayal. Personally, I am not someone interested in politics so it did not strike any chords
			with me.

	<p>TL;DR 3-stars, an interesting book (maybe a 4-star but the topic was not interestin to me)</p>
