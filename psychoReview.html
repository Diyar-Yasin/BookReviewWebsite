		<p>This book is considered a classic. One that stands the test of time and touches many. I disagree. This 
			book sucked. The majority of its pages were chock full of gruesome scenes that left me disgusted. Even
			if there was a purpose to making me feel this way, the fact that the author continued to fall back on it
			to fill up the pages felt lazy. It reminded me of horror movies that are composed entirely of jumpscares.
			Nothing complex, just a facade of fear built upon our surface level human instincts to jump at the sudden
			<em>crash</em> or <em>clammor</em>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another instance of recycling content was the authors lust for naming every designer brand a character 
			was wearing when describing them. The first time it was done, when we learned the 50 plus different
			lotions the main character puts on every morning, I found it an impressive way to show the reader just
			how wealthy and how much time the character had. The 50th time (and this is a estimate not an exaggeration)
			I was ready to close the book right then and there.
		</p>
		<p>
			The genius may have flown over my head, but I just do not get it.

	<p>TL;DR 1-star, worst book I have ever read</p>
