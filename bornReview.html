		<p>A book that not only made me laugh, but informed me about the world. Prior to reading this book,
			I had only ever heard the word appartheid. I learned, through the rich experiences of Trevor Noah, 
			what appartheid was like as well as the unique predicament those of mixed black and white hertiage had.
		</p>
		<p>
			The characters were likable and the store was heartfelt. This is an easier read as well so I
			would recommend it to anyone.

	<p>TL;DR 4-stars, a great book</p>
