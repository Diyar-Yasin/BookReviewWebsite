		<h3>Author: </h3> <p>Mark Manson</p>
		<h3>Genre: </h3>  <p>Self-help</p> 
	

	<div class="p-box">
		<p>This book had interesting ways to outlook on life, however, the novelty of using curse words in a book
			wears thin after the millionth time. Also, Mark writes to the reader as if we have never read a book 
			before in our lives, to a condescending extent.
