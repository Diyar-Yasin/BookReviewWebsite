# BookReview_Website
Code for a website containing reviews on a couple of books I have read.

## Motivation
Interest in learning how websites are made and an attempt at some professional design with CSS.

## Accessing the Files
The HTML/CSS files are directly in the repository.

## Accessing the Website
Visit the website [here](https://diyar-yasin.github.io/BookReviewWebsite/).

## Credits
As much as possible I tried to link the relevant YouTube videos and StackOverflow pages I referenced/used in each script. Most of what was learned was through Traversy Media using their [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) and [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI&t=1s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) tutorials.
